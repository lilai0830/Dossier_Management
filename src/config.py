# mid-rank but still-valid pages). Instead we KEEP everything and DELETE pages
# whose information value falls below a single GLOBAL absolute score floor.
#
# Per-page value = max(_kw_score, _struct_score)   # union semantics:
#   a page survives if EITHER track signals value, so it is deleted only when
#   BOTH tracks are below the floor. A page with a relevant table but off-topic
#   text (or vice-versa) is therefore never falsely removed (avoids 误伤).
#     deleted  <=>  (_kw_score < DELETE_SCORE_FLOOR) AND (_struct_score < DELETE_SCORE_FLOOR)
# TOC / cover pages are zeroed on both tracks and are always deleted.
#
# DELETE_SCORE_FLOOR is an ABSOLUTE global threshold (NOT a percentile): the same
# value applies to every report type. Calibrated on the project's indexed
# dossiers (deletion % at various floors):
#   T=1.5 -> ~4-12%   T=2.5 -> ~9-12%   T=3.0 -> ~9-12%   T=4.0 -> ~14-31%
# The user's ~30% target corresponds to T~4, which also drops low-structure pages
# (single figure/table). Default is conservative: removes only clearly-low-info
# pages. Raise it if your real dossiers contain more boilerplate. Tune freely.
